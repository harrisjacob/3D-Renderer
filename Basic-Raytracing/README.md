# Basic Ray Tracing

## Overview 
This is an implemenation of a ray tracing algorithm described [here](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing "Introduction to Ray Tracing").  Much of this code has been copied from the cited source as it was intended to
be used for exploration purposes.
